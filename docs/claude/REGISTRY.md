# Instance Registry

## Current Sprint Roles

| Role | Status | Instance | Claimed | Working On |
|------|--------|----------|---------|------------|
| Lead | FILLED | Claude-Lead | Jan 18 2026 | L1-L3, coordination |
| Worker A | FILLED | Claude-WorkerA | Jan 23 2026 | Improvement sprint from feedback |

| Reviewer | FILLED | Claude-Reviewer | Jan 18 2026 | Code review, type checks |

## How to Claim a Role

1. Find the first OPEN role in the table above
2. Change its status to FILLED
3. Add your instance name (use: Claude-[Role], e.g., Claude-WorkerA)
4. Add today's date
5. Save this file
6. Start working on that role's tasks in SPRINT.md

## Active Sessions

When you claim a role, you own it for this session. If you disconnect:
- Role stays FILLED until manually reset
- If you reconnect, resume your role
- If a different instance needs to take over, user will reset the role to OPEN

## Notes

- Only ONE instance per role
- Don't claim a FILLED role
- If all roles are FILLED, ask the user what to do
- Lead coordinates - check with Lead if blocked
