Event bus subscription/cleanup correct: wildcards (comms.*, contract.*, inject.*, safemode.*) and destroy() unsubscribes each. tabs.js setupRightPanel signature change matches renderer.js call site. No new IPC needed — bus consumed directly in renderer. innerHTML XSS-safe via escapeHtml. Stream capped at 100. Tests: 18/18 pass. Reviewer (Opus) also approved integration review.",
