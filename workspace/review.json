All callers (scheduleTerminalResize, toggleExpandPane, swapToMainPane, tabs.togglePanel) verified compatible. (2) Scrollback 5000→2000, only affects new Terminal instances. (3) Two document keydown listeners merged into one with early-return routing. Cross-file consistency verified. Confidence HIGH.",
