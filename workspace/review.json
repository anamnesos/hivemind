(1) feature-capabilities.js: Clean module — hasKey correctly validates non-empty trimmed strings, getFeatureCapabilities computes imageGenAvailable as OR of recraft/openai, voiceTranscriptionAvailable from openai only. Accepts env param for testability. (2) settings-handlers.js: get-feature-capabilities IPC returns correct shape. set-api-keys updates process.env BEFORE computing capabilities (lines 113 then 120) — no race condition. Emits feature-capabilities-updated to renderer with guard for destroyed window (isDestroyed + webContents.send check). Capabilities also returned in response payload for synchronous use. unregister correctly removes new handler. (3) oracle-handlers.js: mapOracleError maps 3 specific error patterns (missing image key, missing openai, missing recraft) plus catch-all IMAGE_GENERATION_FAILED. Error strings verified against image-gen.js throw messages — exact match via normalized.includes(). Returns consistent {success, code, error} shape. (4) whisper-handlers.js: MISSING_OPENAI_KEY checked before audio validation (correct order — fail fast). mapWhisperError covers timeout, 401/403 auth, parse failure, plus catch-all. Error strings match callWhisperAPI throw patterns. (5) api-keys.js: Copy updated to 'Saved! Available immediately.' — accurate since set-api-keys now updates process.env in-flight. (6) renderer.js line 851: result.code === 'MISSING_OPENAI_KEY' matches whisper-handlers return shape exactly. (7) Tests: 7 tests across 3 files cover key presence/absence, capability computation, env update + emit, structured error codes, and DI mocks. All 7 pass. Note: renderer has no listener for feature-capabilities-updated yet — expected for backend-first PR, frontend will wire later. Cross-model satisfied: author=Codex, reviewer=Claude Opus.",
