Daemon echoes requestedByEventId for matching. pty-handlers.js awaits each chunk sequentially. injection.js aborts on writeChunked failure — sendTrustedEnter never fires if chunks fail. Graceful fallback via writeWithAckIfAvailable. Cleanup on disconnect/timeout. Cross-model: Codex authored, Claude Opus reviewed. 6 new tests.",
