End-to-end trace flow verified: WS ingress (buildTraceContext) creates traceId/parentEventId/eventId with legacy aliases (correlationId/causationId) -> hivemind-app.js extracts traceContext from data.traceContext||data.message.traceContext and forwards to triggers.sendDirectMessage/broadcastToAllAgents via options.traceContext -> triggers.js normalizeTraceContext resolves from ctx/fallback/generate, passes to sendStaggered which attaches to inject-message IPC -> daemon-handlers.js normalizeTraceContext reads from IPC payload, emits inject.route.received bus event, forwards to enqueueForThrottle with traceContext, processThrottleQueue emits inject.route.dispatched and passes to terminal.sendToPane via options.traceContext -> injection.js sendToPane reuses incoming traceId (does NOT call bus.startCorrelation when traceContext present), doSendToPane builds createKernelMeta closure that chains parentEventId from trace context and auto-advances after each emit -> pty-handlers.js normalizeKernelMetaForTrace enriches kernelMeta with traceId/parentEventId aliases before forwarding to daemonClient.write/resize, buildChunkKernelMeta preserves trace links on chunks -> terminal-daemon.js buildDaemonKernelEvent resolves traceId from params/meta/correlationId with fallback to generateKernelId. KEY FINDINGS: (1) Trace unbroken end-to-end -- no gap identified. (2) Legacy aliases preserved everywhere (correlationId=traceId, causationId=parentEventId). (3) Graceful degradation: all normalizers handle null/missing traceContext, daemon-handlers returns null for empty context, websocket-server only builds trace for send/broadcast types. (4) No injection risk -- trace fields are string-only via toNonEmptyString guards, no eval/interpolation. (5) Consistent shape: {traceId, parentEventId, eventId, correlationId, causationId} across all files. (6) injection.js correctly reuses incoming traceId instead of generating new correlation -- prevents trace fragmentation. (7) Tests verify: WS ack includes traceId, message handler receives traceContext, daemon-handlers forwards to terminal.sendToPane, injection reuses incoming trace, PTY handlers normalize and forward kernel meta with trace links. MINOR NOTES (non-blocking): (A) toNonEmptyString and normalizeTraceContext are duplicated across 4 files -- could extract to shared util in Slice 2. (B) daemon-handlers normalizeTraceContext returns null for empty context while triggers.js always generates -- intentional asymmetry (daemon receives from trusted internal IPC, triggers may originate). (C) injection.js passes traceContext||synthetic-from-corrId to doSendToPane -- ensures backward compat when no trace arrives. Cross-model: author=Codex, reviewer=Claude Opus. Full suite passes (111 suites, 3324 tests).",
