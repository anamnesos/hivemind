Preserved state-gated animations. (2) Removed backdrop-filter from .pane, .pane-header, .panel-tabs — replaced with solid backgrounds matching blurred appearance. Kept on .header only. (3) Replaced 22 transition:all with specific property lists — all verified to cover actual hover/active changes. Net -90 lines CSS. 91 suites / 2917 tests passing.",
