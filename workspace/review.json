(1) PTY resize sync after fitAddon.fit() in initTerminal — two-phase approach for pre/post PTY creation, try/catch guarded. (2) PTY resize sync in reattachTerminal — single call since PTY exists. (3) toggleExpandPane timer replaced with transitionend listener + 300ms fallback. All three resize paths now consistent. Cross-file data flow verified: fitAddon.fit() → terminal.cols/rows → pty.resize() → daemon. Edge cases checked: display:none, rapid toggling, 0x0 dimensions. Confidence HIGH.",
