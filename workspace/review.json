The new code copies targets directly (const notified = [...targets]) and dispatches via sendStaggered, which is the correct delivery path. Comment explains rationale (stale agentRunning during startup/reconnect). Cross-file audit: 6 callers (mcp-bridge.js, hivemind-app.js x3, pipeline.js, plugin-manager.js) all pass explicit targets and expect delivery — none relied on the gate for filtering. New test (triggers-full.test.js line 219) correctly initializes pane 2 as idle, sends direct message, asserts delivery succeeds, and verifies inject-message IPC after timers. websocket-delivery.test.js tests WS server layer, unaffected. No silent failure paths remain for direct messages in PTY mode.",
