Delay (75ms) is ONLY in Gemini PTY branch (line 531). Claude/Codex paths untouched. Default fallback in destructuring. Edge cases: promise interruption safe (safety timer releases lock), rapid sequential injections safe (175ms spacing with retry). Pre-existing concurrent dequeue noted as separate issue. Tests correctly advance fake timers. Confidence HIGH.",
