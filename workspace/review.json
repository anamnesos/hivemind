      "P0: enableMode/disableMode lifecycle is clean — mount/unmount organic UI, hide/restore PTY layout, start/stop sessions. Startup path reuses same pattern. No split-brain.",
      "P1: Delivery truthfulness check (result===true || result?.success===true) handles both legacy boolean and new object shapes. Failed state shows reason. Consistent across daemon-handlers, broadcast, targeted send.",
      "P2: sdk-renderer.appendMessage now returns messageId (line 589). sdk-handlers broadcast returns real sdkBridge.broadcast() result instead of hardcoded true.",
      "P3.1: Double-render guard at renderer.js:2003 (if !organicUIInstance) prevents SDK responses from rendering in both organic UI and sdk-renderer. Note: user-input messages at lines 1242/1281 still write to both — acceptable since sdk-renderer containers are invisible when organic UI is mounted.",
      "P3.2: DOM retention cap MAX_MESSAGES_PER_PANE=200 in sdk-renderer.js. Oldest messages removed via while loop. Edge case: worst-case 201 before trim, acceptable.",
      "P4.1-4.4: 3-agent layout correct (2x2 grid, Architect spans top). Bubble UI with avatars, colors, timestamps, slide-in. Responsive at 1200/800/500px breakpoints. Agent SVG icons in colored badges.",
      "P4.5: Stale '4 Claude sessions' replaced with '3 agent sessions' in index.html lines 92 and 98.",
      "PTY mode: No regression — all organic UI code gated behind organicUIInstance/sdkMode checks.",
      "Tests: 130 suites, 3443 tests all passing. organic-ui.test.js covers agent config, state updates, text display, war room messages, visibility, responsive layout structure.",
      "Minor note: AGENT_CONFIG hardcodes 3 agents — if PANE_IDS changes in config.js, organic-ui.js needs manual sync. Acceptable for now."
