Failure paths: submit_not_accepted emits inject.failed + markPotentiallyStuck. Safety timer extended to 9s for defer+verify+retry window. Constants use internal defaults (consistent with existing pattern). Double-completion guard via completed flag. Minor: retry could double-Enter if first accepted but verification missed signal — mitigated by defer check + CLI ignoring empty submits. 3 new tests (retry-success, retry-exhaustion, event emission). 108 suites / 3287 tests pass.",
