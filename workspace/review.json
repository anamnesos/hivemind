(2) evidence-ledger-store.js: configEnabled derived from config flag, ANDed with options.enabled — correct precedence. logDegradedOnce uses module-level Set for one-time logging — acceptable for singleton store pattern. All 4 degradation paths (disabled, runtime_dir_error, sqlite_driver_unavailable, open_failed) converted to one-time logging. getStatus() exposes configEnabled. (3) Tests: 2 new tests cover disabled-flag degradation (with warn-once assertion) and open-failure one-time logging. Both pass. Existing 5 tests pass with no regressions (config defaults to true so existing behavior unchanged). Minor note: LOGGED_DEGRADE_KEYS is module-scoped not instance-scoped — fine for production singleton, but means test isolation requires resetModules (tests already do this correctly). Cross-model review required (architectural change_type, author=codex, reviewer=claude-opus — models differ, requirement satisfied).",
