(1) detectInstalledClis: safe — short timeouts (2.0s/2.5s), windowsHide, piped stdio, per-CLI exception handling, two-phase locate+version check. (2) Rewrite policy: correct — commandNeedsRewrite only triggers on blank/whitespace or known-unavailable CLI; custom commands with flags (codex --yolo) preserved via extractCliFromCommand startsWith check; unknown commands (null CLI) preserved. (3) No-CLIs edge case: early return with changed:false, existing settings untouched. (4) Startup order: loadSettings -> autoDetect -> ensureCodexConfig, all synchronous before daemon/window. Guarded with typeof check. (5) Downstream consumers (pty-handlers, cli-identity, terminal, sdk-bridge, model-selector) all read paneCommands from ctx.currentSettings — auto-detect writes via saveSettings, same mutation path. No format changes. (6) Tests cover non-clobber, selective rewrite, timeout verification. Cross-model satisfied: author=Codex, reviewer=Claude Opus.",
