Chunking logic correct (no off-by-one), inter-chunk yield (2ms) doesn't race with Enter (50ms after last chunk). Gemini/Codex paths verified untouched. Home key \\x1b[H correct ANSI but needs runtime verification in ink TUI (may be no-op, harmlessly ignored). Tests cover chunk boundaries, fingerprint, failure paths. 107 suites, 3249 tests all passing.",
