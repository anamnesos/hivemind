      "A) Heartbeat dead code cleanup: roleHeartbeats/paneHeartbeats maps, touchHeartbeat, clearHeartbeatForClient, heartbeat handler all removed from websocket-runtime.js. markClientSeen retained for client lastSeen tracking. External callers cleaned: comms-worker-client, comms-worker, websocket-server, hm-send. Grep audit confirms zero remaining references.",
      "B) Teardown bug fix: unregisterTeamMemoryHandlers no longer calls closeTeamMemoryRuntime. Runtime close only runs during app shutdown. Correct separation of concerns.",
      "B) Sweep startup: All 3 sweeps (integrity, belief, pattern) changed from immediate:false to immediate:true. Sweep functions guard on options.immediate !== false, so this fires first run on startup.",
      "Minor: hm-send.test.js has 6 dead heartbeat mock handlers — harmless, opportunistic cleanup.",
