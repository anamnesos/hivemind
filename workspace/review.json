(2) 5s chunk-inactivity decay timer resets state when stream goes quiet, re-arms on every chunk. (3) MAX_COMPACTION_DEFER_MS reduced 30s→8s. Reviewer verified timer lifecycle leak-free, all state transitions covered, no regressions to real compaction detection. Analyst confirmed chunk-inactivity patch addresses premature-clear risk. 100 tests passing.",
