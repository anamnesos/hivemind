Cross-file contracts verified. Init/shutdown ordering correct. Found 2 bugs (shutdown leak + broken IPC listener), both fixed. 75 tests. Gemini cross-model: Approach sound, priority-based sectioning ensures core team status survives token pressure. Watcher + 120s timer combo provides high reliability. arch-hooks.js integration correctly prioritizes snapshots over intent fallbacks. 93 suites / 2996 tests passing.",
