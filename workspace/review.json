(2) Removed pre-flight idle check from doSendToPane — processIdleQueue already handles idle timing, doSendToPane trusts the queue. (3) Focus failure retries once after 200ms, proceeds with Enter anyway instead of abandoning. Also: test mock constants aligned to production (5s/8s/10s), stale '60s' log message replaced with constant interpolation. 91 suites / 2914 tests passing.",
